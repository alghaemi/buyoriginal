`device.css` is a mock stylesheet that specifies how styles should be provided for the specific
screen resolutions. There are following resolution-specific stylesheets:
<ul>
    <li>device-1.0.css - for Android mdpi displays (~160dpi, -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.0)</li>
    <li>device-1.3.css - for Android tvdpi displays (~213dpi, -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3)</li>
    <li>device-1.5.css - for Android hdpi displays (~240dpi, -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5)</li>
    <li>device-2.0.css - for Android xhdpi displays (~320dpi, -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.0)</li>
    <li>device-3.0.css - for Android xxhdpi displays (~480dpi, -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3.0)</li>
</ul>

To use the appropriate stylesheet, you can specify `media` query in the stylesheet link or in the stylesheet itself.
For example, to support all devices, you should include links for all stylesheets (with appropriate `media` attribute
value) in the `<head>` sections of your HTML document, e.g.:

`<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.0)" href="./assets/styles/device-specific/device-1.0.css" />`

All examples provided here refer to mdpi displays.

*Tip:* to target device density in JavaScript, use `window.devicePixelRatio`.

/*
Rem units
=========

You should user either percent or `rem` units used across the documents to make sure that we have the desired size on
all screen densities. We define base font size as 10px on mdpi screens so it can be easily scaled: 13px on the tvdpi
devices, 15px on hdpi devices etc. In a result, you can use 1.0rem as 10dp.

html {
    font-size: 10px;
}

/*
Main logo
=========

The main logo is used on Login and Loading screens. Image is provided via centered not-repeated background.
`min-height` property is the lowest bound of height - in case of landscape screen orientation, we shouldn't cut the
logo but make page content scrollable.

/*
Header logo
===========

The header logo is used on header element in MultiApp module.
